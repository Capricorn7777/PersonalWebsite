               My first job was when I worked at a Little Caesar's the Summer of my Freshman year of High School. I got paid minimum wage, for honestly a hard working job. I was called in about 5 days a week and I would work for at least 5 hours each shift. This job was a rough start for the work force, but it made me realize how much effort is needed in order to perservere at a job.
            </p>
            <p>
               My main jobs were to wash the dishes, clean the work stations, answer the phone and take orders, and to oil the pans for the dough for the pizzas. I was on my feet 100% of the day besides a 15 minute break during the shift. My feet were always so sore after a shift. It was not the most fun job I've held, but it was the perfect job that I needed. I left this job after Summer was up because Marching Band was starting up again, there was no way I would miss that.

               Another job I've held was a Movie Tavern Cashier job during the second semester of my Sophomore Year. The pay was 8.25 an hour. This job was very practical and easy. Before the Pandemic, movie theatres were very popular, in order to keep up with demand the managers hired me. This job simply consisted of handling financial transactions and cleaning the lobby occassionally. The only part about this job that was not pleasant was the management. The managers were very poor at their jobs since they failed to communicate alot to the employees and would not be good about giving breaks to people. I would be starving after not eating since lunch hour at High school, since my shifts typically lasted until 9 or 10 at night.
            </p>
            <p> On the brightside, the people who worked with me were fantastic and I loved talking to each and every one of them. This job really helped me overcome my social anxiety when talking to strangers since I had to talk with them for a living. While not all of them were pleasant, I think it really helped me overcome a mental barrier in my life and allowed me to grow to who I am today, the 'Typical Extrovert'.</p>

               After coming back from my Scholarship Program at GSP Junior Year, I waited until the beginning of the second semester to start working at Bob Evan's as a dishwasher. This job was perfect for me as a student since I was allowed to have an earbud in when I was working since I didn't have to interact with customers; I typically listened to audio books of my AP Literature assignments in order to comprehend and be ready for class so I could 'read' while I worked.
            </p>
            <p>
               The job role was very easy, it just felt like a long night if we were experiencing a rush hour. All my job was to clean dishes, clean the work station, monitor the dishwashing machine, and simply pass dishes through it. This job was a very laid-back setting and it allowed me to multitask and finish both my school work and my job's duties with satisfaction from the supervisor and my teacher alike.

               This one is by far my favorite job that I've taken. The NKU Campus Recreation Center will always hold a place in my heart for being the lifeline to essentially all of my friends here at NKU. I met so many wonderful people while working as membership services at the gym. The job was fairly simple and straightforward, it was processing transactions and operating through a predetermined computer system. I got to utilize said computer while on the job in order to do homework. I was able to get a large majority of class work through most of my classes while waiting on customers. The job, unfortunately, did not pay enough for me to stay long-term, but I know that this job will be my favorite for quite a while.

            <p>
               While the job was easy, leaving it was difficult. I now carry the mentality of creating a social circle around myself and familiarize myself with everyone in the facility, as the people can genuinely make, or break, the right job for me.

               As of writing this, I actually am starting a new job at an Amazon shipping warehouse while in school. I look forward to this opportunity as one where I can make the most out of my life as of this moment. I believe that if I keep making new opportunities for myself, I will continue to be on the path for success.
