               <p>
                  I was born on December 23rd, 2001. I was born into my family with an older brother (and a younger brother to come later). I was a very energetic child who always used their imagination to pretend they had super-powers. However, growing up with my family, I quickly learned that was impossible and quickly became much more practical. I eventually discovered a way to fuel this imagination, I discovered the wonderful world of video games where anything was possible. After this discovery, I quickly became enamored with them. I played many fighting games, fantastical RPG's set in magical worlds, and played all the time with my older brother and bonded with him through them.

               <p>
                  I eventually decided to join a group many know as "Cub Scouts" in second grade, where I met my best friend, Quinlan, whom I still keep in close touch with. I also met another best friend in Elementary School, who drifted away from me. However, we still remained close until High School Graduation.
               </p>
               <p>
                  Growing up past this was so much harder than it should've been. Even though I had my brothers and my best friends to rely on, I was forced to move 3 different times in my life, never understanding why. I was still able to, thankfully, stay at the same school. But I was never aware of WHY my Mom and my brothers had to live at my Grandparent's house until we finally moved when I just got to Middle school.
               </p>
               <p>
                  As it turns out, my father had been using drugs, which ended up costing us so much money that we were forced to leave my childhood home. So as he fell further into his addiction, my family fell further into the red. Many things like money, electronics, and other of our things would go missing. But as naive young boys, we wouldn't be able to believe that our father was the one taking these things and pawning them for money to fuel his addiction.
               </p>
               <p>
                  These were some of the worst years of my life. There were constant arguments over money and many things were broken, walls, furniture, Televisions. These were the years where I realized that the world wasn't "magical" or "all-good" anymore. There were so many things that I didn't know about. But these times shaped me and made me realize the person that I wanted to grow into.

                  Thankfully, during my 8th grade year, my Dad finally realized that he was struggling with a problem that was greater than himself. He was affecting us and our family too. He went into drug rehab, and finally, after years and years of substance abuse, my father was clean and he remains so until this day.
               <p>
                  Eventually, after embracing these familial struggles, I finally entered into high school. I was still unsure of what I wanted to become as I entered High School, but I knew that I would eventually find a calling for myself. I signed up for our High School's Marching Band, a choice I would learn was the best one I have ever made.

               </p>
               <p>
                  I made alot of friends and had so many memorable experiences in Marching Band. Whether it was making fun of sports in the stands at football games, running our shows, or even just sharing a communal goal of being the best and still having fun. I loved the years of Marching Band, there is never a day where I regret it.
               </p>
               <p>
                  Eventually, I was able to decide on a Computer Science Major, which I specifically wanted in order to become a Game Programmer / Designer. I learned to give the spark of life into other's lives just as I had happen for my childhood, since games were such a huge safehaven for me growing up. I took many Computer Programming Classes throughout High School, learning how to use programs such as Unity, learning how to rig 3D models, learning C++, among other lessons.
               </p>
               <p>
                  That brings us to the here and now. I am a Freshman at NKU, oursuin my dreams of becoming a programmer and hopefully to make a difference in the world of those who want an escape from the harsh realities around them. I know that in the future, if I continue my mindset of working hard, I know I will be successful.
